# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
This is a real time bus tracker, which actively moves along to track a bus's location! This map tracks a bus as it travels to all of the stops from MIT to Harvard, letting the user know where it is on its path!

## How To Use
Clone the files from the repository, then double click the "index1.html" file to open it!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I think an interesting update to make would be to change the appearance of the tracker! (Maybe change the icon into different vehicles, objects, animals, etc.)

## License Information
This project was made for the MIT XPro coding bootcamp, all updates were made by me.
